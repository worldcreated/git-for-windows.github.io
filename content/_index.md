Git for Windows focuses on offering a lightweight, native set of tools that bring the full feature set of the <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">Git SCM</a> to Windows while providing appropriate user interfaces for experienced Git users and novices alike.

### Git BASH {#bash}

Git for Windows provides a BASH emulation used to run Git from the command line.  \*NIX users should feel right at home, as the BASH emulation behaves just like the "git" command in LINUX and UNIX environments.

### Git GUI {#git-gui}

As Windows users commonly expect graphical user interfaces, Git for Windows also provides the Git GUI, a powerful alternative to Git BASH, offering a graphical version of just about every Git command line function, as well as comprehensive visual diff tools.

### Shell Integration {#explorer}

Simply right-click on a folder in Windows Explorer to access the BASH or GUI.

### Git Credential Manager {#git-credential-manager}

[Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager) provides secure credential storage with authentication to GitHub, Azure Repos, and other popular Git hosting services.
